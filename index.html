                        I am a young and eager programmer who has been coding videos games or websites using an assortment of computer languages like C#, Python, html, and C++.
                       I have been always looking for new ways to improve and further my experience in coding with taking many coding camps at Western Washington University where I learnt to work in teams on coding projects like working together to design a game and website.
                       That is where I first started truly designing videos games and I continued on from there taking many other course for the next 3 years.
                      After those 3 years I was had just finished my sophomore year in high school when I got accepted into Sno-Isle Tech Center's Video Game Design course.
                     The school has been able to let me specialize on coding videos games using C# and given me the oppurtunity to participate in state competitions for video game design, working and managing large teams of students, and learn many new skills like 3D modeling and web design.
